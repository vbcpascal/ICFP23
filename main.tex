%% Abstract

\begin{abstract}
Macros and higher-order functions are pervasive techniques for implementing domain-specific languages (DSLs),
 which can be seen as translation rules from language constructs of DSLs to the host language.
However, abstraction leakage of translation often downgrades the user-friendliness of DSLs.
In this paper, we propose a semantics-lifting framework that consists of
(i) a general algorithm for deriving a host-independent semantics of a DSL from the semantics of the host language and translation rules,
(ii) a formulation of the correctness and abstraction properties for a lifted semantics, and
(iii) a systematic investigation of assumptions that ensure that a lifted semantics is provably correct and abstract.
To evaluate our semantics-lifting framework and justify our choice of assumptions for correctness and abstraction,
we have implemented a system named Osazone and conducted several case studies, which indicate that our approach is flexible, effective, and practical. Our case studies include semantics lifting from a functional language with references as well as from a C-like imperative language. In particular, these assumptions hold for all our case studies thus the lifted DSL semantics is guaranteed --- by our framework --- to be both correct and abstract.
% \diw{Add one or two sentences to summarize experimental highlights: Our case studies include XXXX. In particular, the assumptions hold for all our case studies thus the lifted DSL semantics is guaranteed---by our framework---to be both correct and abstract.}
% which can derive evaluation rules of DSL constructs based on the semantics of the host language and translation rules.
% We formulate two properties, correctness and abstraction,
 % to illustrate that our algorithm generates correct and host-language independent evaluation rules.
% We have developed a theory of semantics lifting and provided assumptions that preserve correctness and ensure abstraction of semantics lifting.
% Based on the theory, 
% we propose a generic framework to implement DSLs.
% We first introduce new data types in the host language or support new language features via monad;
%  then define the DSL constructs in the extended host language via translation rules.
% Such DSLs are standalone, have a complete semantics definition,
%  and do not depend on any host language.
% we have implemented a system named Osazone and demonstrated its usefulness with several examples.
