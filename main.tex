%% The abstract is a short summary of the work to be presented in the
%% article.
\begin{abstract}
Macros and higher-order functions are pervasive techniques for implementing domain-specific languages (DSLs),
 which can be seen as translation rules from language constructs of DSL to the host language.
However, abstraction leakage of translation often affects the user-friendliness of the DSL.
In this paper, we propose a semantics lifting algorithm,
 which can derive evaluation rules of DSL constructs based on the semantics of host language and translation rules.
We describe the semantics of host language with meta-language,
 and generate semantics of DSL using meta-language as well.
We formulate two properties, correctness and abstraction,
 to illustrate that our algorithm generates correct and host-language independent evaluation rules.

Based on the algorithm, we provide a generic framework to implement DSLs.
First introduce new datatypes in the host language or support new language features via monad;
 then define the DSL constructs in the extended host language via translation rules.
Such DSLs are standalone, have complete semantics definition,
 and do not depend on any host language.
We have implemented this system named Osazone and demonstrate its usefulness with several examples.
