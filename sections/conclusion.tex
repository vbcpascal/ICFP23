\section{Conclusion}

In this paper, we propose a framework to lift language for domain-specific languages.
The key idea of the method is to derive semantics for DSL to maintain abstraction,
 in order to ensure DSL standalone.
Following this idea, we define a meta-language to describe the evaluation and type rules.
We select a pure functional programming language \STLC{} as the host language.
And base on \STLC, users can extend the host language to support new vocabularies and language features
 and specify the DSL constructs by translation rules.
We restrict the rules for the host language and the translation rules separately.
And the correctness and abstraction of the semantic derivation algorithm is proved.
In addition, we implement the tool Osazone,
 which is shown to be useful to develop DSLs.
